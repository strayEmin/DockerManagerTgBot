This project is a second semester term paper at my university. The bot helps in managing docker containers remotely and with full mobility. I don't quite see the practical value, but it was interesting to write it.


One of the bugs that should be fixed when cloning the repository is spam protection, since every attempt to add an IP is an attempt to connect to that IP. The problem was discovered when my best friend sent 10,000 attempts to connect to the FSB website through my bot on my host.
